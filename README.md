## Image Collection Script


This script is designed to automate the process of collecting and storing images for different labels using a camera. It's particularly useful for creating datasets for computer vision tasks, such as training machine learning models. The script captures a specified number of images for each label, stores them in separate directories, and names them uniquely.
